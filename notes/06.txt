Lecture 06
===========

Before Class
------------
1. to telnet a host, firstly it will use DNS protocol to query the host name and translate the domain name into IP addr. Then TCP 3-way handshake will happen to build up a connection between 2 hosts.

2.ARP spoofing:
By forging IP address and MAC address to realize ARP spoofing, a large number of ARP traffic can be generated in the network to block the network. As long as the attacker continuously sends a forged ARP response packet, he can change the IP-MAC entry in the ARP cache of the target host, resulting in network interruption or man in the middle attack. 




open question:
------------------
the way to avoid ARP spoofing:
Bind MAC address
Use static ARP to cache tables
Use the ARP server to look up the ARP conversion table through the server in response to the broadcast from other machines

After Class:
--------------
1. Use telnet to initiate http request: telnet www.steves.edu 80
2. OSI stack
3. TCP/IP Basics: ARP, ND, ICMP ( traceroure, ping), TCP, UDP
