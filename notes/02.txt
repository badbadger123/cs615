Lecture 02:
===============

Before Class:
-------------

-I reviewed concepts of filesystems, outside storage methods, and some hard disk interfaces.
-learnt about EBS volumes and instance storage volumes(less durable).

open question:
-In hw01, we are asked to fill up the available disk to see if we can still run the instance. My puzzle is, since it is the outside storage (disk) that is used up instead of memories, I cannot see why there is possibility that we cannot run the instance.
-The methods I found online to create a big file to use up the disk are not helpful.


After class:
------------

-learn about CVE-2019-18634, I will try to recreate and exploit.
-learn how to set up alias
-learn the reason of the pop-up yes/no question: because we  don't know the key we got is generated by a real server or a man-in-the middle host. We cannot makesure of the server's identity.BTW, the key fingerprint is a hash value of the server's public key. If we compare the fingerprint to varify the identity of the server.
- /dev/xbd0 : sector 0 is the boot sector（MBR，patition table,signature55AA）
-the reason of a negative capacity of the disk : some other space for super users
-disk space and inodes space are both finite
-storage models: DAS, NAS, SAN, cloud storage
-firmware is also a software so it can be hacked and you can detect it since it is not on/in OS
